\addchap{Acknowledgments}

I want to start by paying special regards to my research supervisor Holger Dell. He has been a pillar in my learning, and his support and dedication have been decisive factors in the success of this project.

Martin Aumüller and Riko Jacob (from ITU's Algorithms group) deserve praise for never denying me their precious help when I needed to understand some important concepts.

My peers Weisi Li and Jonas Andersen, to whom I wish success and happiness, thank you for the support and company you offered me during this project.

My two Luísas, my mother and my grandmother, who have always been important references and provided me with the tools and opportunities that allowed me to pursue this journey, you mean the world to me.

Alex, my life partner, thank you for pushing me in to being the best version of myself all the time, but especially during this project.

Lastly, I would like to honor my dearest grandfather Augusto, who, unfortunately, has passed away amid the project. I dedicate this piece of work to him.
