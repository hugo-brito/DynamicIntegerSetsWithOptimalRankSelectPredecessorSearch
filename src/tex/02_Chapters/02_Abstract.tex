In this thesis I present a partial implementation of the "Dynamic Integer Sets with Optimal Rank, Select, and Predecessor Search" data structure authored by Pătrașcu and Thorup in \cite{patrascu2014dynamic}. In their publication, the authors mention that "the most interesting aspect" of their data structure is that "it supports all operations in constant time for sets of size $n = w^{O(1)}$". This claim derives from the fact that the technical details of the data structure are all based on word operations, which in the word-RAM model take constant time.

We will see in detail the techniques used by the authors to enable th
