In this thesis I present a partial implementation of the "Dynamic Integer Sets with Optimal Rank, Select, and Predecessor Search" data structure authored by Pătrașcu and Thorup in \cite{patrascu2014dynamic}. In their publication, the authors mention that "the most interesting aspect" of their data structure is that "it supports all operations in constant time for sets of size $n = w^{O(1)}$". This claim derives from the fact that the technical details of the data structure are all based on word operations, which in the word-RAM model take constant time.

We will see in detail the techniques used by the authors to enable th

from the meeting with holger:
\begin{itemize}
    \item
    much shorter version of the introduction
    
    \item
    2 or 3 very sharp paragraphs tailored for an expert in the field. say what 
    
    \item
    for people who want to get a very quick overview of what you're doing
    
    \item
    don't have to explain the background there. only on an extremely high level. don't need to say "oh a fusion tree is this"
