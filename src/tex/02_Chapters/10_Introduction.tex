From the meeting with Holger:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item
    Background literature
    
    \item
    state of the art
    
    \item
    what is the problem that you're solving
    
    \item
    how does this data structure compare with other data structures that exist (in what sense is it better). just the theory of it
    
    \item
    with lots of references to the different papers that you read
    
    \item
    my background section is very technical, the introduction should be more like a prose on a high level. doesn't need to be technical, the technical parts are later
    
    \item
    in prose describe how does this thesis fit into the literature
    
    \item
    and what are you doing here that is new
    
    \item
    even if it's not finished (it won't be in the tree), I can say that this is the goal that I'm working towards to. the project only makes sense in that context
    
    \item
    the overarching goal is that this implementation is finished such that it can be benchmarked with the other implementations that I mention (this is the big picture)
    
    and this thesis almost gets there.
