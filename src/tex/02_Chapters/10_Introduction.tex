\section{Context}

Rank and select queries are everywhere. Database management systems use them all the time, and the proliferation of these systems is widespread. 

\section{Problem}

Using the findings of \cite{patrascu2014dynamic} to implement a data structure that solves optimally the dynamic predecessor problem.

\section{Approach}

mention that it was implemented in java
mention that both the code and the report expose the paper in such way that it can be re-implemented for instance in DBMSs.

\section{Report Structure}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item
    Topic and context
    \item
    focus and scope
    \item
    relevance and importance
    \item
    questions and objectives
    \item
    overview of the structure

mention the repository

From the meeting with Holger:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item
    Background literature
    
    \item
    state of the art
    
    \item
    what is the problem that you're solving
    
    \item
    how does this data structure compare with other data structures that exist (in what sense is it better). just the theory of it
    
    \item
    with lots of references to the different papers that you read
    
    \item
    my background section is very technical, the introduction should be more like a prose on a high level. doesn't need to be technical, the technical parts are later
    
    \item
    in prose describe how does this thesis fit into the literature
    
    \item
    and what are you doing here that is new
    
    \item
    even if it's not finished (it won't be in the tree), I can say that this is the goal that I'm working towards to. the project only makes sense in that context
    
    \item
    the overarching goal is that this implementation is finished such that it can be benchmarked with the other implementations that I mention (this is the big picture)
    
    and this thesis almost gets there.
\end{enumerate}
