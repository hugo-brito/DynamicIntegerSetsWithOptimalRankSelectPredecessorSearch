\chapter{Final Remarks and Future Work}

\begin{itemize}
    \item
    Constant time bitcount --- maintaining the key compression in constant time
    
    \item
    Benchmarking
    
    \item
    
\end{itemize}

Open problems (what has not been done yet) and done quite concretely:
\begin{itemize}
    \item
    "benchmark" this part of the implementation
    
    \item
    delete methods
    
    \item
    putting the node in a B-tree
    
    \item
    benchmark the full implementation with the others that I have mentioned previously
    
    \item
    my conclusion: a balance between storing more stuff and querying faster, or store close to nothing but longer queries. Query fast but store the least possible
    
    \item
    longer word size could be simulated with allowing certain class variables to be of more than 1 word. simulating a larger w. this touches upon k
    
    \item
    optimize the code. can some of the fields be avoided?
    optimize the code further, such that it becomes competitive.
    
    \item
    profiling, to see which parts of the code the cpu spends most time
\end{itemize}
