\section{Background}

This is some text to showcase the features of this thesis template. For example, it is possible to add a side note with\myMarginnote{I am a side note!}.

In this paragraph, I will add an image as a template:
\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]%
	{03_GraphicFiles/CowLickingNose.jpg}%
\caption[A cow]{A cow licking its nose. Usage with permission of the photographer \textsc{Nicole Barth}, taken from \url{www.flickr.com/photos/46311827@N07/14885545396}.}
\label{fig:CowLickingNose}
\end{figure}

In \figurename~\ref{fig:CowLickingNose}\myMarginnote{Reference to a figure} you see a cow that is licking its nose. The picture was taken by Nicole Barth on 11.08.2014 using a Canon EOS 500D. The original file has a resolution of $4247 \times 2831$ pixels.
Note that the image is also referenced.
